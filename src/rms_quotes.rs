    "GNU, which stands for Gnu's Not Unix, is the name for the complete Unix-compatible software system which I am writing so that I can give it away free to everyone who can use it.",
    "To avoid horrible confusion, please pronounce the G in the word GNU when it is the name of this project.",
    "I consider that the golden rule requires that if I like a program I must share it with other people who like it.",
    "GNU is not in the public domain. Everyone will be permitted to modify and redistribute GNU, but no distributor will be allowed to restrict its further redistribution.",
    "Once GNU is written, everyone will be able to obtain good system software free, just like air.",
    "A hacker is someone who enjoys playful cleverness — not necessarily with computers.",
    "The use of “hacker” to mean “security breaker” is a confusion on the part of the mass media. We hackers refuse to recognize that meaning, and continue using the word to mean someone who loves to program, someone who enjoys playful cleverness, or the combination of the two.",
    "If we are content with knowledge as a commodity, accessible only through a computerized bureaucracy, we can simply let companies provide it. But if we want to keep human knowledge open and freely available to humanity, we have to do the work to make it available that way. We have to write a free encyclopedia.",
    "Very ironic things have happened, but nothing to match this — giving the Linus Torvalds Award to the Free Software Foundation is sort of like giving the Han Solo Award to the Rebel Fleet.",
    "Every decision a person makes stems from the person's values and goals. People can have many different goals and values; fame, profit, love, survival, fun, and freedom, are just some of the goals that a good person might have. When the goal is to help others as well as oneself, we call that idealism.
My work on free software is motivated by an idealistic goal: spreading freedom and cooperation. I want to encourage free software to spread, replacing proprietary software that forbids cooperation, and thus make our society better.",
    "While free software by any other name would give you the same freedom, it makes a big difference which name we use: different words convey different ideas.",
    "We are not against the Open Source movement, but we don't want to be lumped in with them. We acknowledge that they have contributed to our community, but we created this community, and we want people to know this.",
    "The term \"free software\" has an ambiguity problem: an unintended meaning, \"Software you can get for zero price,\" fits the term just as well as the intended meaning, \"software which gives the user certain freedoms.\" We address this problem by publishing a more precise definition of free software, but this is not a perfect solution; it cannot completely eliminate the problem. An unambiguously correct term would be better, if it didn't have other problems.",
    "The official definition of \"open source software,\" as published by the Open Source Initiative, is very close to our definition of free software; however, it is a little looser in some respects, and they have accepted a few licenses that we consider unacceptably restrictive of the users.",
    "Value your freedom or you will lose it, teaches history. \"Don't bother us with politics,\" respond those who don't want to learn.",
    "Geeks like to think that they can ignore politics, you can leave politics alone, but politics won't leave you alone.",
    "Thanks to Mr. Gates, we now know that an open Internet with protocols anyone can implement is communism; it was set up by that famous communist agent, the US Department of Defense.",
    "People said I should accept the world. Bullshit! I don't accept the world.",
    "You can use any editor you want, but remember that vi vi vi is the text editor of the beast.",
    "For personal reasons, I do not browse the web from my computer.",
    "I have to explain that I'm not an anarchist – I have a pro-state gland.",
